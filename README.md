This repository contains the full API of "Around the U.S." project that features user authorization and user registration and handles cards and users.

Using RESTful API design standards, the backend was designed to allow users to create and update their user profile. Image cards are also handled via the API and users can create/delete their own respective card and may also "like" other users images.
